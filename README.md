# Read_memory_not_play_crush_app


In this series, we are creating a music player on Android using the MediaPlayer and MediaController classes. In the first part, we created the app and prepared the user interface for playback. We presented the list of songs on the user device and specified a method to execute when the user makes a selection. In this part of the series, we will implement a Service class to execute music playback continuously, even when the user is not directly interacting with the application.

The android music player successfully installed on my android phone.
when the apps open ,it's interface is as like above the screenshot.
From the screen it's understand that successfully the apps read my phone memory and import the audio file.

but unfortunately when I try to play a song then the apps get crushed and in the phone display it show the 
message  "unfortunately MusicPlayer has stopped"
